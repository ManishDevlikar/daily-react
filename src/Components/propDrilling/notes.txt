Prop drilling in React is the process of passing data from a parent component to a deeply nested child component 
through multiple layers of intermediate components, even if those intermediate components do not need the data themselves. 
This can lead to less maintainable and harder-to-read code, especially in larger applications.

Problems with Prop Drilling:
Redundancy: Passing props through components that donâ€™t need them.
Maintenance: If the structure changes or new props are required, you have to update multiple components.
Readability: The code becomes harder to follow as the prop needs to be traced through multiple layers.

Solutions:
Context API: React's Context API allows you to share data across the entire component tree without prop drilling. 
You can define a context and wrap your components so that any component can consume the data it needs.

State Management Libraries: Libraries like Redux, MobX, or Zustand can help manage state globally in larger applications, 
reducing the need for prop drilling.
