The forwardRef hook in React is used to pass a ref from a parent component down to a child component, 
allowing the parent component to directly access a DOM element or a component's instance in the child. 
It's commonly used when you want to allow parent components to interact with the child component's DOM or instance methods.


Why Use forwardRef?
In normal circumstances, refs cannot be passed down to child components,
 because refs only work directly on DOM elements or class components. 
When you need to pass a ref to a functional component, forwardRef enables this functionality.
