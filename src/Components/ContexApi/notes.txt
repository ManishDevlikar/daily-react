The Context API in React provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. 
This is particularly useful when dealing with data that needs to be accessible by many components, 
such as user information, theme settings, or localization data.

Basic Concepts:
Context: A context is created using React.createContext(). It provides a way to pass data to all components within the provider tree.
Provider: The provider component supplies the context value to all components that need it.
 Any component that wants to use the context data needs to be wrapped by the provider.
Consumer: Components that need the context data can access it using the useContext hook or the Consumer component.

Why Use the Context API?
Avoid Prop Drilling: You can access the context data at any level of the component tree without passing props
 through intermediate components.
Centralized Data Management: Centralize data that multiple components need to access,
 such as user information, theme settings, or application state.
Scalability: The Context API works well for smaller to medium-sized applications.
 For larger apps, you might need to pair it with a more comprehensive state management library like Redux.

Limitations:
Performance: Updating the context value can cause re-renders of all components consuming the context,
 potentially impacting performance in large applications. To mitigate this, you can split contexts by concern or use memoization techniques.
Complexity in Deep Structures: In deeply nested structures, context might still become complex to manage.
 In such cases, it might be worth considering state management libraries.
