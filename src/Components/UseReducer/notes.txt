The useReducer hook in React is a powerful tool for managing state in a more predictable and scalable way,
 especially when dealing with complex state logic or multiple state transitions.
  It's an alternative to useState and is particularly useful when the state has multiple sub-values
   or when the next state depends on the previous one.

What is useReducer?
The useReducer hook allows you to manage state by specifying a reducer function and an initial state.
 A reducer function is a pure function that takes the current state and an action, and returns a new state based on the action.

state: The current state value.
dispatch: A function that you call with an action to update the state.
reducer: A function that determines how the state should change based on the action.
initialState: The initial value of the state.
