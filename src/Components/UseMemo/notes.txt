The useMemo hook in React is used to optimize performance by memoizing (caching) the result of a computation
 so that it is only recalculated when one of its dependencies changes. 
 This is particularly useful for expensive calculations that donâ€™t need to be recalculated on every render.

 const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
