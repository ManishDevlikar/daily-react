React.memo() is a higher-order component (HOC) in React that optimizes performance by preventing unnecessary
 re-renders of functional components. It works by memoizing the result of a component's render,
  meaning it only re-renders the component if its props change.
   This can be particularly useful for components that are expensive to render or that don't need to update unless their props change.

How React.memo() Works
Here's how React.memo() works:

Initial Render: When the component renders for the first time, React.memo stores the result.
Subsequent Renders: On subsequent renders, React.memo compares the new props with the previous ones.
 If the props are the same, the component doesn't re-render; if the props have changed, the component re-renders.
