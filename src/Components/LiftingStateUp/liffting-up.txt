"Lifting up state" in React is a common pattern used to share state between multiple components.
 When you have several components that need to reflect the same changing data,
  it's best to lift the shared state up to their closest common ancestor.
   This way, the state is managed in a single place, and the components that need the state can receive it via props.

Steps to Lift State Up:
Identify the State: Determine what piece of state needs to be shared between components.
Find the Closest Common Ancestor: Identify the closest common ancestor component of all the components that need access to this state.
Move the State to the Ancestor: Move the state to the closest common ancestor. This component will manage the state.
Pass the State as Props: Pass the state down to the child components that need it via props.
Update the State via Callback Functions: If the child components need to update the state,
 pass callback functions from the ancestor component that can be called by the children.
